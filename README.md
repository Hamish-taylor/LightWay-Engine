# LightWay-Engine TEST BRANCH
This branch uses Farser Physics as its physics libary which is not included in this repository
A 2D game engine built ontop of the MonoGame frame work.
This engine is in very early development and is ment more to be a learning experience for me rather than turn into a usable tool.

The current focus of this project is to learn about data orented design.
